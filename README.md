# hello-world

My name's Trevor, I'm very fresh when it comes to coding and I've decided to dedicate however long it takes to learning the ins and outs until it's something I can manage fluently. I tried to understand it at a younger age, but gave up. But with a stronger will and passion than I did then, I hope to succeed in wherever this new road takes me.
