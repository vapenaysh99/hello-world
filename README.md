# hello-world

My name's Trevor. I'm very inexperienced on the topic of coding and so I've decided to dedicate however long it takes into learning the ins and outs of languages like Ruby, Java, HTML and those alike until it's something I can manage fluently. I tried to understand it all at a much younger age as I yearned to be a game developer, but gave up. But with a stronger drive and passion than I did then into becoming a web developer instead, I hope to succeed in wherever this new road takes me.
